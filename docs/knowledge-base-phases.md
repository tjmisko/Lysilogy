# Knowledge base implementation phases

This file is the execution plan for the [knowledge base plan](knowledge-base-plan.md). The design
doc explains *what* each issue builds and why; this file explains *in what order*, *on which
branch*, *touching which files*, and *how to know a phase is done*. Keep it current: tick an issue
when its PR merges and record anything a later agent must know under that phase's notes.

Tracking: [GitHub project 12](https://github.com/users/tjmisko/projects/12). Epics are #11–#18.
Issue numbers below link sub-issues to their design sections.

## Working rules for every issue

1. **Orient.** Read the issue, its design section in `knowledge-base-plan.md`, this file's notes for
   the current phase, and `docs/architecture.md`. Confirm every blocker issue is closed.
2. **Worktree.** `gh worktree create --branch <branch>` from an up-to-date `main`, using the branch
   names below. Never work in the main checkout: it carries unrelated uncommitted PDF-preview work.
3. **Tests alongside code.** Implement the issue's listed tests (named `should … when …`) plus any
   edge cases found while building. Prefer fixture-driven tests; no live network or model calls in
   the test suite.
4. **Quality gates** before opening a PR:

   ```sh
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings   # pedantic + nursery are denied
   cargo test --all-targets
   cd web && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build   # when web/ changed
   ```

   Also run the targeted `npm run test:*` / `smoke:*` scripts for any frontend area touched.
   `npm run smoke` needs a corpus fixture that is absent locally; use the fixture-backed smokes or a
   scratch Playwright harness instead.
5. **Commits and PRs.** Conventional, atomic commits. Open a **draft** PR titled
   `<type>: <summary> (E<x.y>)` whose body says `Closes #<n>`, lists tests added, and records any
   deviation from the design section. Update the design doc in the same PR when behavior deviates.
   Do not merge without the user's approval.
6. **Scratch space.** `/tmp` is a RAM-backed tmpfs. Benchmark vaults, build caches, and large
   fixtures go under `~/.cache/lysilogy/` or the session scratchpad, never `/tmp`.
7. **Stop and ask** when a design decision is not settled by the design doc, when a blocker turns
   out to be incomplete, or when an issue needs human labeling or judgment (E2.5, E4.2).

## Shared files and conflict hotspots

Parallel branches will collide here. Keep edits to these files small (a module declaration, a
route line, a subcommand variant) and rebase onto `main` before requesting review.

| File | Why it is shared |
| --- | --- |
| `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` | New crates (`rusqlite` with `bundled`, graph/metrics crates) |
| `src/lib.rs` | New top-level modules (`objects`, `kb`, `acquisition`, `citations`) |
| `src/main.rs` | New CLI subcommands (`kb rebuild`, `kb eval`, `bench`, `fetch`) in `enum Command` |
| `src/api.rs` | Router composition and `AppState` fields (KB store handle, global jobs) |
| `src/domain.rs` | `PaperOverview`/`PaperMetadata` changes (content hash, links to Works) |
| `web/src/App.tsx` | View modes, routing, command dispatch, key gating |
| `web/src/types.ts`, `web/src/lib/api.ts` | Response types and fetch helpers |
| `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md` | User-facing documentation of new behavior |

Proposed module layout (adjust if the code suggests better seams, and record the change here):

```text
src/objects/        mod.rs (types, objects.json), bibliography.rs, equations.rs, statements.rs,
                    algorithms.rs, enrichment.rs
src/kb/             mod.rs, types.rs, store/ (connection, migrations/*.sql, rebuild), names.rs,
                    titles.rs, resolve.rs, decisions.rs, ingest.rs, lists.rs, graph.rs, gold/
src/acquisition/    mod.rs (state machine), resolve.rs, locate.rs, agent.rs, verify.rs
src/citations/      csl.rs, bibtex.rs, ris.rs, style.rs
src/citation_graph/ cache.rs, budget.rs (E7.1), recommendations.rs (E7.2)
src/api/            objects.rs, kb.rs, acquisition.rs, lists.rs, graph.rs
web/src/components/ FiguresView.tsx, WorkPage.tsx, PersonPage.tsx, ReviewQueue.tsx,
                    ReadingListView.tsx, GraphView.tsx
web/src/lib/        route.ts, kbApi.ts, objects.ts
```

## Phase A: foundations

Goal: the types, stores, parsers, and measurement harnesses that everything else stands on.

Exit criteria: all Phase A issues merged; `kb rebuild` produces an empty but migrated database;
`objects.json` exposes figures, tables, and parsed bibliography entries for a mapped paper; the
gold set exists with labels and the evaluation command reports precision/recall for the naive
exact-key matcher; the 10k benchmark baseline is recorded.

### Wave A1 (parallel, no blockers)

- [ ] **#34 E2.2 KB domain types**. Branch `feat/e2.2-kb-types`.
  Owns `src/kb/mod.rs`, `src/kb/types.rs`, and the `pub mod kb;` line in `src/lib.rs`.
  Reuse or extend `citation_graph::Identifier` rather than duplicating identifier parsing. Merge
  this first: it is small and it creates the `src/kb/` module that A2 branches extend.
- [ ] **#24 E1.1 PaperObject types and objects artifact**. Branch `feat/e1.1-paper-objects`.
  Owns `src/objects/mod.rs`, `src/api/objects.rs`, `web/src/lib/objects.ts`.
  `Figure` currently lives in `src/source_index.rs` inside the cached `reading-index.json`
  (schema version 6). Wrap it; do not move figure detection or bump the reading-index schema
  unless required. `objects.json` records the reading-index generation it was derived from.
- [ ] **#19 E0.1 Synthetic 10k vault and benchmarks**. Branch `feat/e0.1-scale-bench`.
  Owns a generator and benchmark subcommand or script. The vault goes under
  `~/.cache/lysilogy/bench-vault/`. Commit the baseline report to
  `docs/experiment-reports/`.
- [ ] **#20 E0.2 Content-hash paper identity**. Branch `feat/e0.2-content-hash`.
  Touches `src/library.rs`, `src/store.rs`, `src/domain.rs`. `sha2` is already a dependency.
  Renames currently orphan `papers/<id>/` because `PaperId` hashes the relative path; notes are
  keyed separately by relative path in `Notes/`, so decide and document how notes follow a move.
- [ ] **#63 E7.1 Provider cache and rate budgets**. Branch `feat/e7.1-provider-cache`.
  Owns `src/citation_graph/cache.rs`, `budget.rs`; touches `http.rs`. Preserve the existing
  1.1-second spacing, `Retry-After` cooldown, and credential redaction behavior in
  `docs/citation-graph-sources.md`; the cache must never store credentials.

### Wave A2 (after the listed blockers merge)

- [ ] **#25 E1.2 Backend bibliography extraction and parsing** (after #24).
  Branch `feat/e1.2-bibliography`. Owns `src/objects/bibliography.rs`; touches
  `web/src/lib/paperLinks.ts` and `PdfLinkHints.tsx`. Port the entry splitting and marker matching
  in `paperLinks.ts` (numeric, ranges, raised superscripts, author–year with suffixes) to Rust and
  keep `npm run test:paper-links` and `npm run smoke:link-hints` passing against the backend
  output. Ambiguous matches stay unresolved.
- [ ] **#33 E2.1 SQLite store, migrations, and rebuild** (no issue blocker; sequenced after #34 to
  avoid `src/kb/` conflicts). Branch `feat/e2.1-kb-store`. Owns `src/kb/store/`; adds `rusqlite`
  (`bundled`) to `Cargo.toml` and `kb rebuild` to `src/main.rs`. Database at
  `<data>/kb/kb.sqlite`, WAL mode, FTS5 trigram tokenizer (confirm the bundled SQLite enables
  FTS5). Include the 500k-Work synthetic neighborhood query benchmark from the design section.
- [ ] **#35 E2.3 Person name parser** (after #34). Branch `feat/e2.3-names`. Owns
  `src/kb/names.rs`. Pure functions plus a large table-driven test.
- [ ] **#36 E2.4 Title normalizer** (after #34). Branch `feat/e2.4-titles`. Owns
  `src/kb/titles.rs`. Pure functions; the FTS5 index population itself lands with #33 or #38,
  whichever merges later.

### Wave A3 (human in the loop)

- [ ] **#37 E2.5 Resolution gold set and evaluation** (after #25). Branch `feat/e2.5-gold-set`.
  Owns `src/kb/gold/` and a `kb eval` subcommand. Mine ~200 name and title pairs from parsed
  bibliographies in `local-articles`, including hard negatives. Store only bibliographic
  metadata, never full text. **Stop and hand the unlabeled/disagreeing pairs to the user** in a
  plain-text file they can edit in nvim; resume once labeled. The 0.99 precision gate becomes a
  `cargo test` that loads the gold set.

### Phase A notes

- Main's working tree has uncommitted changes to `web/src/App.tsx`, `HomePage.tsx`,
  `PaperPreview.tsx`, `pdfPreview.ts`, and new `pdfPreviewCache.ts`/`pdfPreviewStorage.ts`. Those
  are unrelated and not on `main`; E0.4 (Phase B) will likely conflict with them once committed.
- Live provider hosts were blocked in an earlier development sandbox. Adapter tests are fixture
  based; keep new provider code the same way.

## Phase B: resolution and paper objects

Goal: local papers populate a resolved KB with citation evidence, and the reader shows a Figures
tab with equations, statements, and proofs.

Exit criteria: ingesting the local library produces Works, Persons, and local citation edges that
pass the gold-set gate; the KB API serves Works, Persons, and neighborhoods; the Figures tab
replaces Glossary; new link hints work; the 10k vault meets the E0.1 targets for scan, home, and
batch extraction.

### Wave B1

- [ ] **#26 E1.3 Numbered equations** (after #24). Branch `feat/e1.3-equations`.
- [ ] **#27 E1.4 Statements and proofs** (after #24). Branch `feat/e1.4-statements-proofs`.
- [ ] **#28 E1.5 Algorithms and listings** (after #24). Branch `feat/e1.5-algorithms`.
- [ ] **#30 E1.7 Object enrichment** (after #24). Branch `feat/e1.7-object-enrichment`. Follow the
  stage-cache keying and exact-quote verification used by key quotes in `src/analysis/`.
- [ ] **#31 E1.8 Figures tab** (after #24). Branch `feat/e1.8-figures-tab`. The Glossary wiring to
  replace is in `App.tsx` (`ViewMode`, `VIEW_ORDER`, `openGlossary`, command allowlist, `onGloss`
  props, tab button, render branch) and `useGlobalKeys.ts`.
- [ ] **#38 E2.6 Resolution engine** (after #33, #35, #36, #37). Branch `feat/e2.6-resolution`.
- [ ] **#39 E2.7 Decision log** (after #33, #34). Branch `feat/e2.7-decisions`.
- [ ] **#21 E0.3 Incremental catalog scan** (after #19). Branch `feat/e0.3-incremental-scan`.
- [ ] **#22 E0.4 Home virtualization** (after #19). Branch `feat/e0.4-home-virtualization`.
- [ ] **#23 E0.5 Concurrent batch ingest** (after #19). Branch `feat/e0.5-batch-ingest`.

E1.3, E1.4, and E1.5 each own one detector file and share only registration in
`src/objects/mod.rs`.

### Wave B2

- [ ] **#29 E1.6 Link hints for new objects** (after #26, #27). Branch `feat/e1.6-object-hints`.
- [ ] **#40 E2.8 Ingest local papers** (after #20, #25, #38, #39). Branch `feat/e2.8-ingest-local`.
- [ ] **#41 E2.9 Ingest provider snapshots** (after #38, #39). Branch `feat/e2.9-ingest-providers`.

### Wave B3

- [ ] **#42 E2.10 KB API** (after #40). Branch `feat/e2.10-kb-api`.

## Phase C: acquisition, lists, and routes

Goal: references can be fetched incrementally to mapped local copies, Works and Persons have
pages, and reading lists exist with a keyboard view.

Exit criteria: "fetch all references" on a mapped paper advances each reference through recorded
stages with verified downloads; `#work=`, `#person=`, `#list=` routes work; lists can be built and
reordered by keyboard; citations export as CSL-JSON, BibTeX, and RIS.

### Wave C1

- [ ] **#44 E2.12 Routes plus Work and Person pages** (after #42). Branch `feat/e2.12-kb-routes`.
  Replace the `selectedId === null` home test with a discriminated route; keep `#home` and
  `#paper=` working.
- [ ] **#45 E3.1 Acquisition state and global jobs** (after #33, #34). Branch
  `feat/e3.1-acquisition-jobs`. `src/jobs.rs` is paper-scoped; model the global runner on the
  reader-tools job pattern rather than forcing `JobTracker` to hold non-paper keys.
- [ ] **#52 E4.1 CSL-JSON, BibTeX, RIS** (after #34). Branch `feat/e4.1-citation-export`.
- [ ] **#55 E5.1 Reading list model** (after #33, #34). Branch `feat/e5.1-reading-lists`.
- [ ] **#59 E6.1 Neighborhood and metrics** (after #42). Branch `feat/e6.1-graph-metrics`.

### Wave C2

- [ ] **#46 E3.2 Deterministic identifier resolution** (after #45, #63). Branch
  `feat/e3.2-identifier-resolution`.
- [ ] **#48 E3.4 Agent fallback** (after #45). Branch `feat/e3.4-agent-fallback`. Reuse
  `AnalysisService::reader_tool` with `live_web`; treat reference text as untrusted input.
- [ ] **#49 E3.5 Download verification** (after #45). Branch `feat/e3.5-download-verification`.
  Downloads go through `AppState::import_remote_pdf`.
- [ ] **#50 E3.6 Post-download policy** (after #45, #23). Branch `feat/e3.6-download-policy`.
- [ ] **#56 E5.2 Reading-list view** (after #44, #55). Branch `feat/e5.2-list-view`.

### Wave C3

- [ ] **#47 E3.3 Open-access locators** (after #46). Branch `feat/e3.3-oa-locators`. Unpaywall
  requires a contact email; reuse `LYSILOGY_CITATION_MAILTO`.

### Wave C4

- [ ] **#51 E3.7 Fetch UI** (after #42, #46, #47, #48, #49). Branch `feat/e3.7-fetch-ui`. Migrate
  existing `SavedReference` records in `reader-tools.json`.

### Phase C notes

## Phase D: graph, AI lists, and refinements

Goal: the literature becomes explorable: graph view, AI-generated reading lists with visible
relationships, review queue, styled citations, and read-next suggestions.

Exit criteria: the graph view navigates a neighborhood entirely by keyboard; an AI-generated list
resolves proposals, marks unresolved ones, and shows its relationship graph; the review queue
writes decisions; styled citations render for the target styles.

### Wave D1

- [ ] **#32 E1.9 Clickable proofs** (after #27, #31). Branch `feat/e1.9-clickable-proofs`.
- [ ] **#43 E2.11 Review queue** (after #42, #44). Branch `feat/e2.11-review-queue`.
- [ ] **#53 E4.2 Styled citations** (after #52). Branch `feat/e4.2-styled-citations`. Spike
  hayagriva vs citation-js first and **ask the user** before committing to one.
- [ ] **#54 E4.3 Copy and export commands** (after #52, #55). Branch `feat/e4.3-citation-commands`.
- [ ] **#57 E5.3 AI-generated reading lists** (after #45, #46, #55). Branch `feat/e5.3-ai-lists`.
- [ ] **#60 E6.2 Graph view** (after #44, #59). Branch `feat/e6.2-graph-view`.
- [ ] **#64 E7.2 Semantic Scholar recommendations** (after #42, #63). Branch
  `feat/e7.2-s2-recommendations`.
- [ ] **#65 E7.3 Author identity** (after #38, #63). Branch `feat/e7.3-author-identity`.

### Wave D2

- [ ] **#61 E6.3 Keyboard graph navigation** (after #60). Branch `feat/e6.3-graph-keys`.
- [ ] **#62 E6.4 Communities and read-next** (after #59, #60). Branch `feat/e6.4-read-next`.
- [ ] **#58 E5.4 List relationship graph** (after #56, #59, #60). Branch `feat/e5.4-list-graph`.
